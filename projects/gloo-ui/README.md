## GRPC web

### Example usage

[example react app](https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/tree/master/client/grpc-web-react-example)

## Development against the backend

The UI can talk to the backend through...

### Running against an API server locally

### Running against an API server in Kubernetes

If the API server and proxy are already deployed to Kubernetes, then you can use Kubernetes port-forwarding
to be able to talk to them.
