# Multicluster Admission Webhook Tests

These tests (along with the rest of the multicluster-admission-webhook code) were copied from skv2-enterprise
in order to remove solo-projects' dependency on skv2-enterprise.

The Makefile targets don't currently all work, and the codegen doesn't generate code that compiles, but they are
currently left here as reference.

We may want to clean up or fix the tests in the future so that they run as part of ci.
