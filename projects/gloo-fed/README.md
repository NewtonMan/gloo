# Gloo Federation

Gloo Edge Federation allows users to manage the configuration for all of their Gloo Edge instances from one place, no matter what platform they run on.

## Background
Gloo Edge Federation elevates Gloo Edgeâ€™s powerful routing features beyond the environment they live in, allowing users to create all new global routing features between different Gloo Edge instances. Gloo Edge Federation provides:
- Consistent configuration 
- Service failover 
- Unified debugging
- Automated Gloo Edge discovery across all of your Gloo Edge instances

## Build
*All make targets are currently defined in the [Makefile](./../../Makefile) at the root of the repository.*

The `VERSION` env variable determines the name of the tag for the image.

You may either inject the version yourself:
```bash
VERSION=<version name> make gloo-fed-docker
```

Or rely on the auto-generated version:
```shell
make gloo-fed-docker
```

## Release
During a Gloo Edge Enterprise release, the `gloo-fed` image is published to the [Google Cloud Registry](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gloo-edge/GLOBAL) and the [Quay repository](https://quay.io/repository/solo-io/gloo-fed).


## Local Development
### Prerequisites
Before setting up Gloo Fed, make sure you have performed the following steps:

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and the following packages:

      brew install go
      brew install kubectl
      brew install kind
      brew install helm
      brew install findutils
      brew install gnu-sed
      brew install yarn

* Update the PATH in your .zshrc or .bashrc file:

      export GOPATH="${HOME}/go"
      export GOROOT="$(brew --prefix golang)/libexec"
      export PATH=${GOPATH}/bin:${GOROOT}/bin:/usr/local/opt/findutils/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
      PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"

* Install protoc version 3.6.1:

On a mac:

      brew install protoc@3.6

On a linux:

      curl -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.6.1/protoc-3.6.1-osx-x86_64.zip
      unzip protoc-3.6.1-osx-x86_64.zip -d protoc3
      mv protoc3/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
      mv protoc3/include/* /usr/local/include/
      rm -r protoc-3.6.1-osx-x86_64.zip protoc3

* Add to `/etc/hosts`:

      # kind setup
      127.0.0.1       host.docker.internal

### Running and testing Gloo Fed locally
Note that since this is an Enterprise feature, you will need a Gloo License Key below:

```shell script
# Run setup-kind in order to provision two kind clusters.
# This will create two clusters, "local" and "remote".
# "local" will run the gloo-fed control plane, and "remote" will run gloo.

GLOO_LICENSE_KEY=<your license key here> ./projects/gloo-fed/ci/setup-kind.sh local remote

# Register the clusters using glooctl.
glooctl cluster register --cluster-name kind-local --remote-context kind-local --local-cluster-domain-override host.docker.internal --federation-namespace gloo-system
glooctl cluster register --cluster-name kind-remote --remote-context kind-remote --local-cluster-domain-override host.docker.internal --federation-namespace gloo-system

# (Optional) Apply some test data (as of this writing, a FederatedUpstream and FederatedVirtualService) with:

kubectl apply -f projects/gloo-fed/example/resources/
# Verify that the upstream was federated to the remote cluster
kubectl get upstream -n gloo-system --context kind-remote i-was-federated -oyaml


# Now we're all set up!
# Let's view our remote Gloo installation.

kubectl get glooinstance -n gloo-system -oyaml

# To teardown kind clusters, run

./ci/teardown-kind.sh local remote
```
