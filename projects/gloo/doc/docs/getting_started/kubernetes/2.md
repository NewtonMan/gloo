### What you'll need

If you haven't already deployed Gloo and the example swagger service on kubernetes, [go back to the first tutorial](1.md)

Now that we've seen the traditional routing functionality of Gloo (i.e. API-to-service), let's try doing some function routing.

Let's take a look at the upstream that was created for our petstore service:

         glooctl get upstream default-petstore-8080 -o yaml

         ...
             serviceSpec:
               rest:
                 swaggerInfo:
                   url: http://petstore.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/swagger.json
                 transformations:
                   addPet:
                     body:
                       text: '{"id": {{ default(id, "") }},"name": "{{ default(name, "")}}","tag":
                         "{{ default(tag, "")}}"}'
                     headers:
                       :method:
                         text: POST
                       :path:
                         text: /api/pets
                       content-type:
                         text: application/json
                   deletePet:
                     headers:
                       :method:
                         text: DELETE
                       :path:
                         text: /api/pets/{{ default(id, "") }}
                       content-type:
                         text: application/json
                   findPetById:
                     body: {}
                     headers:
                       :method:
                         text: GET
                       :path:
                         text: /api/pets/{{ default(id, "") }}
                       content-length:
                         text: "0"
                       content-type: {}
                       transfer-encoding: {}
                   findPets:
                     body: {}
                     headers:
                       :method:
                         text: GET
                       :path:
                         text: /api/pets?tags={{default(tags, "")}}&limit={{default(limit,
                           "")}}
                       content-length:
                         text: "0"
                       content-type: {}
                       transfer-encoding: {}
         ...
         
We can see there are functions on our `default-petstore-8080` upstream. These functions were populated automatically by
the `discovery` pod. You can see the function discovery service in action by running `kubectl logs -l gloo=discovery`

The [function spec](../../v1/upstream.proto.sk.md) you see on the functions listed above belongs to the transformation plugin<!--(TODO)-->. This powerful
plugin configures Gloo's [request/response transformation Envoy filter](https://github.com/solo-io/envoy-transformation)
to perform transform requests to the structure expected by our petstore app.

In a nutshell, this plugin takes [Inja templates](https://github.com/pantor/inja) for HTTP body, headers, and path as its parameters 
(documented in the plugin spec<!--(TODO)--> and transforms incoming requests from those templates. Parameters for these templates 
can come from the request body (if it's JSON), or they can come from parameters specified in the extensions on a route<!--(TODO)-->.

Let's see how this plugin works by creating some routes to these functions in the next section.

### Steps

1. Start by creating the route with `glooctl`:

        glooctl add route \
          --path-exact /petstore/findPet \
          --dest-name default-petstore-8080 \
          --rest-function-name findPetById 

    Notice that, unlike the previous tutorial, we're passing an extra argument to `glooctl`: `--rest-function-name findPetById`.

    Let's go ahead and test the route using `curl`:
    
        export GATEWAY_URL=$(glooctl gateway url)
        curl ${GATEWAY_URL}/petstore/findPet

        [{"id":1,"name":"Dog","status":"available"},{"id":2,"name":"Cat","status":"pending"}] 

    Looking again at the function `findPetById`, you'll notice the template wants a variable called `id`:
    
         - name: findPetById
           spec:
             body: ""
             headers:
               :method: GET
             path: /api/pets/{{id}}

1. Try the request again, but now add a JSON body which includes the `id` parameter:

        curl ${GATEWAY_URL}/petstore/findPet -d '{"id": 1}'
    
        {"id":1,"name":"Dog","status":"available"}
        
        curl ${GATEWAY_URL}/petstore/findPet -d '{"id": 2}'
        
        {"id":2,"name":"Cat","status":"pending"}    


    Great! We just called our first function through Gloo. 
    
    <br/>

1. Parameters can also come from headers. Let's tell Gloo to look for `id` in a custom header.

    Let's take a look at the route we created:
        
        glooctl get virtualservice -o yaml

        ---
        metadata:
          name: default
          namespace: gloo-system
          resourceVersion: "6939"
        status:
          reportedBy: gateway
          state: Accepted
          subresourceStatuses:
            '*v1.Proxy gloo-system gateway-proxy':
              reportedBy: gloo
              state: Accepted
        virtualHost:
          domains:
          - '*'
          name: gloo-system.default
          routes:
          - matcher:
              exact: /petstore/findPet
            routeAction:
              single:
                destinationSpec:
                  rest:
                    functionName: findPetById
                    parameters: {}
                upstream:
                  name: default-petstore-8080
                  namespace: gloo-system

    We need to add a route with a parameter that tells Gloo how to grab template parameters from the request.

    Add `parameters` to the route's `extensions` like so:

        glooctl add route \
          --path-prefix /petstore/findWithId/ \
          --dest-name default-petstore-8080 \
          --rest-function-name findPetById \
          --rest-parameters ':path=/petstore/findWithId/{id}'
                 
    Now Gloo knows to look for the parameter named `id` in a header called `x-pet`.
    
    Try `curl` again, this time with the new header:
    
        curl ${GATEWAY_URL}/petstore/findWithId/1
    
        {"id":1,"name":"Dog","status":"available"}
