### <a name="Struct">Struct</a>

Description: `Struct` represents a structured data value, consisting of fields
which map to dynamically typed values. In some languages, `Struct`
might be supported by a native representation. For example, in
scripting languages like JS a struct is represented as an
object. The details of that representation are described together
with the proto support for the language.

The JSON representation for `Struct` is JSON object.

```yaml
"fields": map<string, .google.protobuf.Value>

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| fields | [map<string, .google.protobuf.Value>](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/map<string,-.google.protobuf.-value>) | Unordered map of dynamically typed values. |  |
  
### <a name="FieldsEntry">FieldsEntry</a>

Description: 

```yaml
"key": string
"value": .google.protobuf.Value

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| key | string |  |  |
| value | [.google.protobuf.Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/value) |  |  |
  
### <a name="Value">Value</a>

Description: `Value` represents a dynamically typed value which can be either
null, a number, a string, a boolean, a recursive struct value, or a
list of values. A producer of value is expected to set one of that
variants, absence of any variant indicates an error.

The JSON representation for `Value` is JSON value.

```yaml
"null_value": ***TODO ENUMS***!
"number_value": float
"string_value": string
"bool_value": bool
"struct_value": .google.protobuf.Struct
"list_value": .google.protobuf.ListValue

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| null_value | ***TODO ENUMS***! | Represents a null value. |  |
| number_value | float | Represents a double value. |  |
| string_value | string | Represents a string value. |  |
| bool_value | bool | Represents a boolean value. |  |
| struct_value | [.google.protobuf.Struct](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/struct) | Represents a structured value. |  |
| list_value | [.google.protobuf.ListValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/list-value) | Represents a repeated `Value`. |  |
  
### <a name="ListValue">ListValue</a>

Description: `ListValue` is a wrapper around a repeated field of values.

The JSON representation for `ListValue` is JSON array.

```yaml
"values": []google.protobuf.Value

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| values | [[]google.protobuf.Value](struct.proto.sk.md#Value) | Repeated field of dynamically typed values. |  |
