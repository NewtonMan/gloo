### API Reference for Gloo, The Hybrid Application Gateway

API Version: `gloo.solo.io.v1`

Gloo is a high-performance, plugin-extendable, platform-agnostic API Gateway built on top of Envoy. Gloo is designed for microservice, monolithic, and serverless applications. By employing function-level routing, Gloo can completely decouple client APIs from upstream APIs at the routing level. Gloo serves as an abstraction layer between clients and upstream services, allowing front-end teams to work independently of teams developing the microservices their apps connect to.
