### Package: `gloo.solo.io`  
This file contains the basic definition for the Upstream proto object.

Upstreams are a top-level resource in Gloo.

Upstreams contain data used for routing requests. They reflect real services, actively running
e.g. inside kubernetes, hosted by a cloud provider, running at a static IP, etc.

The specific type of upstream is determined by the type of `upstream_spec` on the upstream object.

Some upstreams are auto-discovered by Gloo via service discovery backends like kubernetes and consul. These upstreams
contain the information pulled from the service discovery backend, such as the service's listening ports and registry identifier.

Static IP addresses (or sets of them) can be defined with their own upstream type, the `Static` upstream. Static upstreams
can be created using Gloo's yaml-based CRD interface in Kubernetes, as well as using the command-line `glooctl`.

Some upstreams reference credentials for an account with a public Cloud Provider such as AWS or Azure. Credentials are
stored in Kubernetes secrets (with experimental support for Vault), and the Upstream object is required to provide a reference
to the secret. Cloud Proivder upstreams must also be added manually, although their contents (e.g. available Lambda functions
for an AWS region) can be discovered automatically by Gloo.

### <a name="Upstream">Upstream</a>

 

Upstreams represent destination for routing HTTP requests. Upstreams can be compared to
[clusters](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v1/cluster_manager/cluster.html?highlight=cluster) in Envoy terminology.
Each upstream in Gloo has a type. Supported types include `static`, `kubernetes`, `aws`, `consul`, and more.
Each upstream type is handled by a corresponding Gloo plugin.

```yaml
"upstream_spec": .gloo.solo.io.UpstreamSpec
"status": .core.solo.io.Status
"metadata": .core.solo.io.Metadata
"discovery_metadata": .gloo.solo.io.DiscoveryMetadata

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `upstream_spec` | [.gloo.solo.io.UpstreamSpec](plugins.proto.sk.md#UpstreamSpec) | Type-specific configuration. Examples include static, kubernetes, and aws. The type-specific config for the upstream is called a spec. |  |
| `status` | [.core.solo.io.Status](../../../../../solo-kit/api/v1/status.proto.sk.md#Status) | Status indicates the validation status of the resource. Status is read-only by clients, and set by gloo during validation |  |
| `metadata` | [.core.solo.io.Metadata](../../../../../solo-kit/api/v1/metadata.proto.sk.md#Metadata) | Metadata contains the object metadata for this resource |  |
| `discovery_metadata` | [.gloo.solo.io.DiscoveryMetadata](upstream.proto.sk.md#DiscoveryMetadata) | Upstreams and their configuration can be automatically by Gloo Discovery if this upstream is created or modified by Discovery, metadata about the operation will be placed here. |  |
