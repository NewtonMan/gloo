# Open Source Contributions
Standards that are used in Gloo Edge Enterprise, are based on the ones defined in [Gloo Edge Open Source](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/main/devel/contributing).

_In general, we aim to keep the definitions in a single place, so if there are updates to our contribution practices that apply to both Open Source and Enterprise Gloo Edge, add them to the Open Source repo._
