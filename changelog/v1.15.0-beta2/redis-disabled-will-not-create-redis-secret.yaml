      Setting the helm value, `redis.disabled` to `true`, will no longer create the `redis` secret when `global.extensions.glooRedis.enableAcl` is set to `true`, it's default value.
      You will no longer be allowed to set `redis.disabled` with `redis.clientSideShardingEnabled` anymore, doing so will throw an error in helm.
