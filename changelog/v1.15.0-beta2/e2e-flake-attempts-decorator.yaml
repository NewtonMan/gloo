    description: >-
      Add the FlakeAttempts decorator to the most flaky tests in the e2e suite.
      Our hope is that this alleviates some of the pains that developers experience,
      by having these tests re-run automatically. Our goal, is that once tests are not
      flaky, we are able to remove this decorator.
