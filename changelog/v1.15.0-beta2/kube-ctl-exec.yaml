    description: >-
      Allow custom securityContext definitions to be merged with the default definition instead of overwriting with the use of the `mergePolicy` field. 
      This is useful, for example, for setting the `runAsNonRoot` field to `true` without overwriting the default securityContext. 
      The default, which is also indicated by the attribute `mergePolicy` value of `no-merge` results in the defined securityContext being used in the chart. 
      If the value is set to `helm-merge` the defined securityContext will be merged with the default securityContext with the helm merge command, 
      with defined values overriding the defaults. If the value is unrecognized, an error is thrown.
      
      Add custom securityContexts to gloo-fed deployments

      Add gloo's DeploymentSpec to gloo-fed deployment containers (gloo-fed and gloo-fed-api)

      Add the ability to define custom gloo-fed RBAC roles. This is done by defining the roles in gloo-fed.glooFed.roleRules

      Add the ability to define volumes/volume mounts for gloo-fed deployments. This is done with the values 
      gloo-fed.glooFed.volumes to define the volumes and gloo-fed.glooFed.glooFed.volumeMounts to define the glooFed container's volume mounts.
