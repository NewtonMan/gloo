      Add support for an optional parameter `terminatingCiphers` for deprecated cipher passthrough.
      Ciphers for this feature can be added in the `sslConfig` of an httpgateway or virtualservice (if using the isolate by vsfunctionality).
      If set only these ciphers will be considered as native for passthrough decisions.
      This resolves an issue where clients that offer native but disallowed ciphers would not be eligible for passthrough.
