changelog:
  - type: HELM
    description: >-
      Add the new helm value `global.extensions.dataplanePerProxy` (default false). When true, Gloo will deploy a set
      of dataplane resources for each proxy deployment (i.e., gateway/ingress). These resources include the extauth
      server and rate limit server, as well as their dependent resources. Note that if `dataplanePerProxy` is enabled,
      that each `Gateway` resource will need to be updated to point to their respective dataplane, via the
      `gatewayProxies.NAME.gatewaySettings.customHttpGateway` and/or the
      `gatewayProxies.NAME.gatewaySettings.customHttpsGateway` helm values.
