  description: >
    The API keys can now be provided as simple Kubernetes secrets. Instead of being nested in a YAML document inside
    the secret data, the key is now simply the value of the `api-key` data key. This change is backwards compatible,
    i.e. Gloo will still support existing secrets with the old format. `glooctl create secret apikey` will now generate
    secrets with the new format.
