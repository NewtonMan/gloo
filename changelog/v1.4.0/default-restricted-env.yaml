changelog:
  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: >
      Enable gloo and glooe to run in a fully restricted kubernetes environment. Gloo pods and jobs now all start
      as a non-root user. Most pods can be run as a custom user by specifying a deployment.runAsUser value. Service
      accounts have been created for extauth and ratelimit. Grafana, Redis and Nginx are all now initialized as
      non-root users also.
