- type: FIX
  description: >
    As part of each Gloo Enterprise release we publish information about all the dependencies that we use. This is
    needed for external auth plugin developers to be able to create plugins compatible with a particular Gloo
    Enterprise version. As we have recently started to use Go Modules instead of Dep to build Gloo, this change adds the
    `go.mod`/`go.sum` files to the list of published dependency info.
