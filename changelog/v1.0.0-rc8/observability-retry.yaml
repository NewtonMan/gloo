  - type: FIX
    description: >
      There is a race condition where the `observability` pod can become ready before Grafana is ready. This can cause
      the dynamic dashboards to be missing, as `observability` tries only a single time to make the Grafana service call.
      This change introduces a 10-second retry window into the `observability` sync loop.
