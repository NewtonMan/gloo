  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: |
      Added calling the end_session_endpoint on logout of the user session. This
      will invalidate the user's session token. There are two ways this is configured,
      by applying the methodType to the OAuth Config API. GET and POST methodTypes
      can be applied to the EndSessionProperties in the OAuth2 API Configurations.
