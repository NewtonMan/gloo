    resolvesIssue: true
    description: >
      Fixes an issue where gloo would repeatedly send unchanged configs to the extauth service, triggering excessive logging
      and user confusion. This was caused by an inconsistent ordering of configurations when hashing them to determine
      if anything had changed.
