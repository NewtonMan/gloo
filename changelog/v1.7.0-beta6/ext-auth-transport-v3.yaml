changelog:
- type: HELM
  description: >
    Allow setting the API version of the `ext_authz` transport protocol via the new `global.extensions.extAuth.transportApiVersion` Helm value.
    The allowed values are `V2` and `V3`, with the latter being the default.
    Users who are running a custom external auth server should make sure that the server supports `V3` of the API.
    If it does not, `transportApiVersion` should be set to `V2` to maintain backwards compatibility. This does not apply
    to the default Gloo Edge Enterprise external auth server, which supports both protocol versions.
    Note that `transportApiVersion` needs to be `V3` in order for the external auth server to be able to emit dynamic metadata.
