  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: >
      Gloo's validation webhook now validates inja compilation syntax before accepting/rejecting virtual services that
      use transformations. Note that strict validation is still disabled by default, and must be enabled in the Gloo
      settings. Users can now rely more on `kubectl apply --server-dry-run` against live clusters to properly validate
      whether config is valid before attempting to apply them to their cluster.
