      Tap filter alpha release. Implements support for HTTP and GRPC output
      sinks. Both sinks fully buffer messages before sending them out to the
      tap server. Only supports defining the tap filter on the Gateway at this
      time. A number of fields (such as the output format type) are also not
      supported at this time.
