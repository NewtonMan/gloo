    description: >
      Adds `log_sensitive_info` option to GraphQL schema options, which configures if gateway-proxy debug logs will include debug
      information pertaining to individual requests / responses. By default, no request/response information is logged,
      but `log_sensitive_info` can be set to `true` to log relevant debug information per GraphQLApi.
