    description: >
      Adds beta support for schema stitching and pre-beta support for type merging. This functionality is exposed in the GraphQLApi resource,
      under the `stitchedSchema` field. This allows for a single stitched GraphQL api to delegate responses to GraphQL subschemas and stitch
      the responses back together to a coherent response.
