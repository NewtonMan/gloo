    description: >-
      Update Redis package to v9 to support redis v7 https://github.com/redis/go-redis/issues/2085#issuecomment-1181357149
      Note that this does make 2 major changes to the package but neither seem to affect us.
      First it changes the vanity url pathing (in other words import looks different but isnt).
      Second it makes Pipelines no longer thread safe. Fortunately on a transaction we create a new pipeline.
      Pipeline() returns a new pipeline making our implementation safe.
      This allows for redis v7 while also not breaking v6 per https://github.com/redis/go-redis/commit/7b4f2179cb5dba3d3c6b0c6f10db52b837c912c8
