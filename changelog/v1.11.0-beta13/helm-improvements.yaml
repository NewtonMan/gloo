    description: |
      `glooStats.serviceMonitor` used to be responsible for exposing ports on services and pods
      as well as configure the Pod and ServiceMonitor resources. This setting has been broken down
      into finer-grained settings:
      `glooStats.serviceMonitorEnabled` exposes the monitoring port on the service,
      `glooStats.serviceMonitor` controls the ServiceMonitor CR shipped with Gloo Edge Enterprise,
      `glooStats.podMonitorEnabled` exposes the monitoring port on the pod template,
      `glooStats.podMonitor` controls the PodMonitor CR shipped with Gloo Edge Enterprise.
      This is a breaking change that enables users to manage their own telemetry stack with Gloo Edge.
