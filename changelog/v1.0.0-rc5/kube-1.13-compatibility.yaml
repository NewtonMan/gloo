    description: >
      Bump Prometheus to 9.5.1 from 9.3.1 to fix a compatibility issue with k8s 1.13. The root cause is that
      Prometheus 9.3.1 creates ClusterRoles for unused Prometheus components that have an empty `rules:` object.
      Prometheus 9.5.1 creates ClusterRoles for those unused components that have `rules: []`.
