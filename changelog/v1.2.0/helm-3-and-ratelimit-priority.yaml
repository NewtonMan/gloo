- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    Removed the `installConfig.installationId` Helm value to track the resources that belong to a Gloo installation.
    Helm keeps track of resources by storing release information in a Kubernetes Secret in the namespace Gloo was
    installed in (this is the default with Helm 3 and can be changed via the `HELM_DRIVER` environment variable).
    `glooctl install` and `glooctl uninstall` now take the same approach (under the hood the two commands now delegate
    to their counterparts in the Helm 3 libraries).
