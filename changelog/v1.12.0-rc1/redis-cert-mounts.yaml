    description: |
      Redis TLS connection enabled with OAuth API redis options SocketType set to 
      TLS, and added certificates "ca.crt", "tls.crt", and "tls.key"
      to the TlsCertMountPath. As stated for client certificate authentication 
      [here in the redis setup manual](https://redis.io/docs/manual/security/encryption/#client-certificate-authentication).
      Setting the helm values for "global.extensions.extAuth.deployment.redis.certs"
      both the "secretName" and "mountPath", will mount the secret to the ext-auth deployment.
      The secret needs to contain at least "ca.crt" for enabling the RootCA.
      Add "tls.crt", and "key.crt" files for adding the certificate.
      In addition the mountPath has to be added to the API OAuth Redis Options
      under the "TlsCertMountPath" option.
