    description: >
      Introduce enterprise API to support configuring a new per route option
      on lambda invocation to act as if it was an AWS API Gateway.
      This is an enterprise only feature that is intended to be used to ease
      migration from using AWS API Gateway for lambda invocation to Gloo.
      To opt into the feature, configure `unwrap_as_api_gateway` on the AWS DestinationSpec.
      Create a new enterprise AWS Lambda plugin, which supports new API Gateway functionality
