changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    Allow running the rate limit filter before the auth filters. NOTE that, when this new setting is used,
    it will result in the loss of the extauth-aware rate limiting feature (ie, different rate limits
    for authenticated vs unauthenticated users)

- type: FIX
  description: >
    Fix a bug where if the strongly typed rate limit config was provided and the deprecated untyped config
    was NOT provided, then gloo would return an error
