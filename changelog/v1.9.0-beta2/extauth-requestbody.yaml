changelog:
  - type: HELM
    description: |
      Extauth request body settings are now exposed as `global.extensions.extAuth.requestBody` in the helm chart.
      The three available settings are `maxRequestBytes`, `allowPartialMessage`, and `packAsBytes`. For instance, setting
      `global.extensions.extAuth.requestBody.maxRequestBytes=64000` would set the maximum size of a message body the extauth filter
      will hold in memory to 64KiB.
