  dependencyTag: v0.6.1
- type: FIX
  description: >
    Currently, when the Gloo Enterprise external auth server detects any updates in the authentication configuration,
    it cancels all the running auth modules and restarts them with the updated configuration. This can cause modules
    that take some time to restart to be offline for a non-negligible amount of time, during which any requests hitting
    them will return 403 responses. This change add better handling of configuration updates; specifically, the server
    now restarts only the `AuthService` instances that have been actually updated.
