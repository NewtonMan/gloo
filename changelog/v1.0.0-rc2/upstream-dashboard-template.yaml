changelog:
  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: >
      Allow customization of the template used to generate per-upstream dashboards. This is accomplished through
      the addition of the new Helm setting observability.upstreamDashboardTemplate. When used, that field should
      be set to a valid Go template, where the variables {{.Uid}} and {{.EnvoyClusterName}} may be used. The
      former is derived from the upstream name (cap at 40 chars, replace "-" with "_") and the latter is
      $serviceNamespace-$serviceName-$servicePort_$upstreamNamespace if the upstream is a k8s service, and
      $upstreamName_$upstreamNamespace otherwise. The recommended way to set this new Helm field is by using
      "--set-file observability.upstreamDashboardTemplate=./path/to/your/template/file" in your Helm invocation.
