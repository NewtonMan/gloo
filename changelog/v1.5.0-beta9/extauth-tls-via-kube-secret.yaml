changelog:
  - type: FIX
    description: >
      The extauth service now supports tls connections to the extauth service itself using a kubernetes secret rather than
      using cert and key files. To enable extauth tls mode, set `TLS_ENABLED` to true in the extauth service by setting the 
      helm value `global.extensions.extAuth.tlsEnabled` to `true`. To pull the cert and key from a kubernetes secret, set
      the helm value `global.extensions.extAuth.secretName` to the name of the tls secret containing the tls.crt and tls.key
      data. Note that the secret must be in the same namespace as the extauth deployment.
