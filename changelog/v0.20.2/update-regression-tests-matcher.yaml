- type: NON_USER_FACING
  description: >
    Our regression tests currently use a virtual service that matches all domains and all routes. This causes the extauth
    server to be continuously hit by FDS requests. This makes the logs very noisy and puts unnecessary load on the system.
    This change restricts the scope of the matcher on the virtual service.
