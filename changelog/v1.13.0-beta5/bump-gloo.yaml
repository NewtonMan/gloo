    description: >-
      Updates the default gloo liveness probe (disabled by default) to use a new http server that always returns http 200 "ok".
      The old probe would wait for xds before signalling health, which in large environments could lag while EDS is warming.
      This could, in rare cases, cause the gloo pod to needless bounce while it was warming.
