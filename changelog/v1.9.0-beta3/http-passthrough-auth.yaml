    description: >
      Adds support for HTTP Passthrough Auth. This allows for authentication requests to be "passed through"
      to an external HTTP server. The HTTP server can authorize requests by responding back with a HTTP 200 response.
      In addition, additional configuration allows for the HTTP server to modify the original request headers to the upstream.
