    description: >
      Allows users to use JWT with the [boolean expression extauth API](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/enterprise/options/extauth/v1/extauth.proto.sk/#authconfig) to create authentication logic between JWT and other ext-auth services.
      Previously, JWT authentication only ran before extauth. This adds stages to the JWT authentication, which can now be configured to run before extauth and after extauth.
