changelog:
  - type: HELM
    description: >
      Add a new helm value, `create_license_secret`, which when set to false, disables the license key kubernetes secret
      from being installed with Gloo Enterprise. This enables users to run a full gitops workflow where they manage their
      own kubernetes license key secrets.
