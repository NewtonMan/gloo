    description: >
      When terminating the extauth server (e.g., k8s rolling update) envoy continues to
      route to the old extauth server endpoints in addition to the new ones (load-balancing
      between the two 50-50) until the old one's health check completely fails five minutes
      later. This PR adds a health check interceptor that sends a 
      "x-envoy-immediate-health-check-fail" header to envoy when the extauth server 
      shuts down. This tells envoy to exclusively route to the new (healthy) server.
