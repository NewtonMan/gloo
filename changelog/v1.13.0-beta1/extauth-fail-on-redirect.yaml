CHANGELOG:
- type: NEW_FEATURE

  resolvesIssue: false
  description: |
    Add config to enable users to opt-in to configuring an AuthConfig to fail when
    an OIDC provider returns a redirect instead of returning that redirect to the
    client. When set to true, a 401 unauthorized will be returned instead of 302.
    A user may want to configure this option when using OIDC auth flows in unconventional
    ways such as API calls where the client is unable to handle the redirect.
