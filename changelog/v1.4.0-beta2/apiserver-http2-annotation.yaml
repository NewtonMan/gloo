changelog:
  - type: FIX
    description: |
        Added the `gloo.solo.io/h2_service: "true"` annotation to the `apiserver` Kubernetes service, so `discovery`
        will set `useHttp2` to `true` on the corresponding upstream. This will allow Gloo to correctly proxy the
        `apiserver`, which serves as a backend for the Gloo Admin UI. See the linked issue for more details.
