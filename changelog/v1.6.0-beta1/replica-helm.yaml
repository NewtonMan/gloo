changelog:
  - type: HELM
    description: >
      Add the ability to specify a number of replicas for the redis, rate-limit,
      apiserver, and observability deployments via helm values.
      Note: Extra redis replicas still won't scale properly until
      https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3269 is addressed.

  - type: HELM
    description: >
      Add the ability to NOT specify a number of replicas for the redis, rate-limit,
      apiserver, observability and extAuth deployments explicitly in deployments.
      This prevents issues when using flux and horizontal autoscaling.
      See https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/1.18.0/faq.html#how-can-i-prevent-flux-overriding-the-replicas-when-using-hpa
      for more details.
