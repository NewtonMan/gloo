    description: >-
      When using the Kubernetes Gateway API, envoy cluster names corresponding to Kubernetes Service Upstreams
      are now in a new more parseable format that allows us to extract info about the Service for metrics:
      `upstreamName_upstreamNs_svcNs_svcName_svcPort` (underscore-separated). Note that as long as Kubernetes
      Gateway integration is enabled (i.e. Gloo Gateway installed with `kubeGateway.enabled=true`), both
      Edge and Kubernetes Gateway proxies will use the new cluster format.
