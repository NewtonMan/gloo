      Expand the PlacementStatus API on FederatedResources, to allow for a set of statuses
      to be maintained on a single resource, each keyed by the namespace that the Gloo Federation
      operator is running in. This enables a canary upgrades for Gloo Fed, where mutltiple operators can 
      report their own status.
