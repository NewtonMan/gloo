- type: HELM
  description: >
    The Helm template for the `Settings` resource was defined as a `pre-install` Helm hook until now. This was done to
    avoid races with the Gloo pods, which used to create a default `Settings` resource if none was present. Since we
    removed this feature, the `Settings` template does not need to be a hook anymore. This change promotes it to a
    regular Helm release resource.
