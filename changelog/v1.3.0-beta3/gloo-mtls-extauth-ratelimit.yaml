changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: |
    Enable mTLS authentication in between Gloo and our default Extauth and Rate Limiting server. When the environment variable GLOO_MTLS is set to `enabled` in the rate-limit or extauth deployments, those processes will look for keys, certs, and trusted CAs in the following file locations:
    - /etc/envoy/ssl/tls.key
    - /etc/envoy/ssl/tls.crt
    - /etc/envoy/ssl/ca.crt
    Then, they will connect to Gloo using TLS instead of an insecure gRPC connection. This is all done by default if Gloo Enterprise is installed through Helm with the helm setting `global.glooMtls.enabled` is set to true.
