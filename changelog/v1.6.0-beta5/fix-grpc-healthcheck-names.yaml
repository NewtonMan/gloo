    description: >-
      Fix the grpc service names in health checks. This fixes a regression that was introduced in Gloo enterprise
      v1.5.0-beta8 and v1.4.7. Without this fix, the rate-limit and ext-auth grpc services will fail health checks
      and go into panic mode (which by default, ignores health checks, so requests still work).
