changelog:
  - type: HELM
    description: |
      The timeout for Envoy when checking authorization with the extauth server is now exposed as `global.extensions.extAuth.requestTimeout`
      in the helm chart. For instance, setting `global.extensions.extAuth.requestTimeout=1s` would set the timeout to one second.
