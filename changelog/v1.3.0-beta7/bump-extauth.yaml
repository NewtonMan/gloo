    description: |
      The OPA debug-level logging now includes data about the OPA input, eval traces, and result set. 
      The following command can be used to stream a clean OPA trace with those three things from 
      the extauth service: 
      `kubectl logs -n gloo-system deploy/extauth -f | jq -r -j "select(.trace != null) | .trace"`
