  description: >
    Initial setup for developer portal. Specifically, we import and generate code for the dev portal protobuf definitions.
    We also create a separate set of components to register dev portal gRPC services with the apiserver. These components
    are disabled by default and can be activated by setting the `DEV_PORTAL_ENABLED` env on the container.
