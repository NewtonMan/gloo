  - type: FIX
    description: >-
      Fix issue where gateway-level extauth could not be overriden by lower-level virtualhost, route, and weighted
      destination extauth config. Also fix issue where extauth config at listener level wouldn't override the global
      setting for userIdHeader. Also fix issue where ratelimit config for `rateLimitBeforeAuth` at listener level
      wouldn't override the global default, similarly true for the "basic" ratelimit API.
