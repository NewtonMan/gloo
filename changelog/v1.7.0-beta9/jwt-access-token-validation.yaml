changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    The Gloo Enterprise external auth server can now easily be configured to validate OAuth2.0 access tokens that
    conform to the [JSON Web Token (JWT) specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) via the `AccessTokenValidation` API.
    Tokens are validated using a JSON Web Key Set (as defined in [Section 5 of RFC7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-5)),
    which can be either inlined in the configuration or fetched from a remote location via HTTP.
    The server will validate both the JWT signature and the standard claims it contains.
    If the JWT has been successfully validated, its set of claims will be added to the `AuthorizationRequest`
    state under the "jwtAccessToken" key. Additionally, if the server has been configured accordingly, the identifier
    of the authenticated user will be added to the request streams as dynamic metadata and/or a header.
