      Update Upstream templates for Enterprise services to have the same health check config (interval: 10s, 
      healthyThreshold: 3, unhealthyThreshold: 3). This fixes a bug whereby on pod restart, traffic would continue to
      be sent to deleted rate-limit pods, causing those requests to not be processed by rate-limit.
