    issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3055
    description: >-
      Add support for OAuth2 access token validation via token introspection (i.e., opaque access tokens) to the
      extauth service. Also add support for configuring the userinfo OIDC endpoint to the new access token validation
      API, which allows users to leverage the userinfo response in extauth plugins.

    description: >-
      Fix some race conditions in extauth config generator test
  - type: FIX
    issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3208
    description: >-
      Correctly append custom headers added from extauth plugins when a `UserID` is also
      being set in the extauth plugin (or from any other extauth plugin in a chain of `AuthConfigs`).
      Previously, headers added from extauth plugins were ignored (i.e. not available to the
      upstream service) when a `UserID` was set.
