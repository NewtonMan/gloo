    description: >-
      Introduce a readinessProbe on the ext auth deployment, ensuring
      that the extauth pod is not marked as ready until it has received Gloo configuration.
      We had previously relied on envoy health checks, so this protects agains the edge
      case where k8s terminates a pod, and we dont want to direct traffic to the new one,
      until it has received configuration.
