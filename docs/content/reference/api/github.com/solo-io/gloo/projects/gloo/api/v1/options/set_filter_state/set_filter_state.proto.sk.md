### SetFilterState

 
Configuration for the Set-Filter-State HTTP Filter

```yaml
"onRequestHeaders": []set_filter_state.options.gloo.solo.io.FilterStateValue

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `onRequestHeaders` | [[]set_filter_state.options.gloo.solo.io.FilterStateValue](../set_filter_state.proto.sk/#filterstatevalue) |  |




---
### FilterStateValue

 
A filter state key and value pair.

```yaml
"objectKey": string
"factoryKey": string
"readOnly": bool
"sharedWithUpstream": .set_filter_state.options.gloo.solo.io.FilterStateValue.SharedWithUpstream
"skipIfEmpty": bool

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `objectKey` | `string` | Filter state object key. The key is used to lookup the object factory, unless :ref:`factory_key <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.common.set_filter_state.v3.FilterStateValue.factory_key>` is set. See :ref:`the well-known filter state keys <well_known_filter_state>` for a list of valid object keys. |
| `factoryKey` | `string` | Optional filter object factory lookup key. See :ref:`the well-known filter state keys <well_known_filter_state>` for a list of valid factory keys. |
| `readOnly` | `bool` | If marked as read-only, the filter state key value is locked, and cannot be overridden by any filter, including this filter. |
| `sharedWithUpstream` | [.set_filter_state.options.gloo.solo.io.FilterStateValue.SharedWithUpstream](../set_filter_state.proto.sk/#sharedwithupstream) | Configures the object to be shared with the upstream internal connections. See :ref:`internal upstream transport <config_internal_upstream_transport>` for more details on the filter state sharing with the internal connections. |
| `skipIfEmpty` | `bool` | Skip the update if the value evaluates to an empty string. This option can be used to supply multiple alternatives for the same filter state object key. |




---
### SharedWithUpstream



| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `NONE` | Object is not shared with the upstream internal connections. |
| `ONCE` | Object is shared with the upstream internal connection. |
| `TRANSITIVE` | Object is shared with the upstream internal connection and any internal connection upstream from it. |
